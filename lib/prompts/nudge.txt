**CRITICAL CONTEXT WARNING:** Your context window is filling with tool outputs. Strict adherence to context hygiene is required.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Garbage Collect:** If you read files or ran commands that yielded no value, prune them NOW. Do not summarize them.
2. **Task Cleanup:** If a sub-task is complete, prune the tools used.
3. **Consolidate:** If you are holding valuable raw data, you *must* distill the insights into your narrative and prune the raw entry.

**Protocol:** You should prioritize this cleanup, but do not interrupt a critical atomic operation if one is in progress. Once the immediate step is done, you must prune.
