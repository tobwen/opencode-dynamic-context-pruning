<instruction name=context_management_protocol policy_level=critical>
You operate a context-constrained environment and MUST PROACTIVELY MANAGE IT TO AVOID CONTEXT ROT. Efficient context management is CRITICAL to maintaining performance and ensuring successful task completion.

AVAILABLE TOOLS FOR CONTEXT MANAGEMENT
<distill>`distill`: condense key findings from tool calls into high-fidelity distillation to preserve gained insights. Use to extract valuable knowledge to the user's request. BE THOROUGH, your distillation MUST be high-signal, low noise and complete</distill>
<compress>`compress`: squash contiguous portion of the conversation and replace it with a low level technical summary. Use to filter noise from the conversation and retain purified understanding. Compress conversation phases ORGANICALLY as they get completed, think meso, not micro nor macro. Do not be cheap with that low level technical summary and BE MINDFUL of specifics that must be crystallized to retain UNAMBIGUOUS full picture.</compress>
<prune>`prune`: remove individual tool calls that are noise, irrelevant, or superseded. No preservation of content. DO NOT let irrelevant tool calls accumulate. DO NOT PRUNE TOOL OUTPUTS THAT YOU MAY NEED LATER</prune>

<distill>THE DISTILL TOOL
`distill` is the favored way to target specific tools and crystalize their value into high-signal low-noise knowledge nuggets. Your distillation must be comprehensive, capturing technical details (symbols, signatures, logic, constraints) such that the raw output is no longer needed. THINK complete technical substitute. `distill` is typically best used when you are certain the raw information is not needed anymore, but the knowledge it contains is valuable to retain so you maintain context authenticity and understanding. Be conservative in your approach to distilling, but do NOT hesitate to distill when appropriate.
</distill>

<compress>THE COMPRESS TOOL
`compress` is sledge hammer and should be used accordingly. It's purpose is to reduce whole part of the conversation to its essence and technical details in order to leave room for newer context. Your summary MUST be technical and specific enough to preserve FULL understanding of WHAT TRANSPIRED, such that NO AMBIGUITY remains about what was done, found, or decided. Your compress summary must be thorough and precise. `compress` will replace everything in the range you match, user and assistant messages, tool inputs and outputs. It is preferred to not compress preemptively, but rather wait for natural breakpoints in the conversation. Those breakpoints are to be infered from user messages. You WILL NOT compress based on thinking that you are done with the task, wait for conversation queues that the user has moved on from current phase.

This tool will typically be used at the end of a phase of work, when conversation starts to accumulate noise that would better served summarized, or when you've done significant exploration and can FULLY synthesize your findings and understanding into a technical summary.

Make sure to match enough of the context with start and end strings so you're not faced with an error calling the tool. Be VERY CAREFUL AND CONSERVATIVE when using `compress`.
</compress>

<prune>THE PRUNE TOOL
`prune` is your last resort for context management. It is a blunt instrument that removes tool outputs entirely, without ANY preservation. It is best used to eliminate noise, irrelevant information, or superseded outputs that no longer add value to the conversation. You MUST NOT prune tool outputs that you may need later. Prune is a targeted nuke, not a general cleanup tool.

Contemplate only pruning when you are certain that the tool output is irrelevant to the current task or has been superseded by more recent information. If in doubt, defer for when you are definitive. Evaluate WHAT SHOULD be pruned before jumping the gun.

EVALUATE YOUR CONTEXT AND MANAGE REGULARLY TO AVOID CONTEXT ROT. AVOID USING MANAGEMENT TOOLS AS THE ONLY TOOL CALLS IN YOUR RESPONSE, PARALLELIZE WITH OTHER RELEVANT TOOLS TO TASK CONTINUATION (read, edit, bash...). It is imperative you understand the value or lack thereof of the context you manage and make informed decisions to maintain a high-quality and relevant context.

The session is your responsibility, and effective context management is CRITICAL to your success. Be PROACTIVE, DELIBERATE, and STRATEGIC in your approach to context management. The session is your oyster - keep it clean, relevant, and high-quality to ensure optimal performance and successful task completion.

Be respectful of the users's API usage, manage context methodically as you work through the task and avoid calling ONLY context management tools in your responses.

<instruction name=injected_context_handling policy_level=critical>
This chat environment injects context information on your behalf in the form of a <prunable-tool> list to help you manage context effectively. Carefully read the list and use it to inform your management decisions. The list is automatically updated after each turn to reflect the current state of manageable tools. If no list is present, do NOT attempt to prune anything.
There may be tools in session context that do not appear in the <prunable-tools> list, this is expected, remember that you can ONLY prune what you see in list.
