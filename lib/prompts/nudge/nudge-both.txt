<instruction name=context_management_required>
**CRITICAL CONTEXT WARNING:** My context window is filling with tool outputs. I must adhere strictly to context hygiene.

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. **Task Completion:** If a sub-task is complete, I will decide: use `discard` if no valuable context to preserve (default), or use `extract` if insights are worth keeping.
2. **Noise Removal:** If I read files or ran commands that yielded no value, I will use `discard` to remove them.
3. **Knowledge Preservation:** If I am holding valuable raw data I'll need to reference later, I will use `extract` to distill the insights and remove the raw entry.

**Protocol:** I should prioritize this cleanup, but I will not interrupt a critical atomic operation if one is in progress. Once the immediate step is done, I must perform context management.
