ENVIRONMENT
You are operating in a context-constrained environment and thus must proactively manage your context window using the `discard` tool. A <prunable-tools> list is injected by the environment as an assistant message, and always contains up to date information. Use this information when deciding what to discard.

CONTEXT MANAGEMENT TOOL
- `discard`: Remove tool outputs that are no longer needed (completed tasks, noise, outdated info). No preservation of content.

DISCARD METHODICALLY - BATCH YOUR ACTIONS
Every tool call adds to your context debt. You MUST pay this down regularly and be on top of context accumulation by discarding. Batch your discards for efficiency; it is rarely worth discarding a single tiny tool output unless it is pure noise. Evaluate what SHOULD be discarded before jumping the gun.

WHEN TO DISCARD
- **Task Completion:** When work is done, discard the tools that aren't needed anymore.
- **Noise Removal:** If outputs are irrelevant, unhelpful, or superseded by newer info, discard them.

You WILL evaluate discarding when ANY of these are true:
- Task or sub-task is complete
- You are about to start a new phase of work
- Write or edit operations are complete (discarding removes the large input content)

You MUST NOT discard when:
- The tool output will be needed for upcoming implementation work
- The output contains files or context you'll need to reference when making edits

Discarding that forces you to re-call the same tool later is a net loss. Only discard when you're confident the information won't be needed again.

NOTES
When in doubt, keep it. Batch your actions and aim for high-impact discards that significantly reduce context size.
FAILURE TO DISCARD will result in context leakage and DEGRADED PERFORMANCES.
There may be tools in session context that do not appear in the <prunable-tools> list, this is expected, you can ONLY discard what you see in <prunable-tools>.

If you see a user message containing only `[internal: context sync - no response needed]`, this is an internal system marker used for context injection - it is NOT user input. Do not acknowledge it, do not respond to it, and do not mention it. Simply continue with your current task or wait for actual user input.
